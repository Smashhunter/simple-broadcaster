# simple-broadcaster

Simple C project that realize one to all chat feed using sockets.

## Structure

After building there will be 2 programs: server and client.
Server is store, process and control clients.
Client is (probably) ncurses chat that connects to server using his IP.
Server will work only in LAN networks for now, so you can try some VPN's like Radmin to make connection.
